## Computing Architecture
**English:**
Computing architecture is the design or structure of how computing systems are built and how their components (hardware, software, network) interact with each other. It decides ka data kahan store hoga, kaise process hoga, aur kaise users tak pohanchayega.

**Urdu:**

Ye basically ek blueprint hota hai jo batata hai system ke parts kaise mil ke kaam karte hain — jaise processor, storage, network, aur software ek dusre se kaise interact karte hain.

**Example:**

A computer’s CPU architecture like x86 or ARM.

Ek bank ka IT setup — jo servers, database, aur network devices ka combination hota hai.

## Centralized Computing
**English:**
All computing and storage is done in one central location (like a big main server), and users connect to it remotely.

 **Urdu:**
Isme sara kaam ek hi central computer ya server pe hota hai, aur users bas terminal se connect hote hain. Agar central system down ho gaya to sab kaam ruk jata hai.

**Example:**

Mainframe systems in old banks.

Ek office ka server jahan sari files store hain, aur employees network se open karte hain.

## Client-Server Architecture
**English:**
The system is divided into clients (users) and servers (machines providing services). Clients send requests, servers respond.

**Urdu:**
Isme client request bhejta hai (jaise browser me website open karna) aur server us request ka jawab deta hai.

**Example:**

Web browsing: Your browser (client) → Google server → result back to you.

Office printer server: Employees (clients) send print requests to a printer server.

## Industrial Control System (ICS)
**English:**
ICS are computer-based systems used to monitor and control industrial processes like manufacturing, power plants, and water treatment.

**Urdu:**
Yeh wo systems hain jo factories, electric grid, ya machinery ko monitor aur control karte hain automatically. Isme SCADA, PLCs, aur sensors use hote hain.

**Example:**

SCADA system controlling electricity distribution.

PLC controlling conveyor belts in a factory.

## Cloud Computing
**English:**
Cloud computing means using computing services (servers, storage, databases, AI, etc.) over the internet instead of owning physical hardware.

**Urdu:**
Ap apne computer pe data store ya process nahi karte — aap internet ke through kisi aur ke server pe kaam karte ho. Isse scalability aur cost efficiency milti hai.

**Example:**

Google Drive for file storage.

AWS EC2 for running applications online.

## Microservices
**English:**
Microservices architecture breaks an application into many small, independent services that communicate via APIs.

**Urdu:**
Bari application ko chhote chhote parts me tod dete hain — har part ka apna kaam hota hai aur wo alag develop aur update ho sakta hai. Agar ek service down ho to poora system nahi rukta.

**Example:**

An e-commerce site:

User service (login, signup)

Product service (product listing)

Payment service (checkout, transactions)
